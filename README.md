# http333 - CSE 333 Web Server

This project is a multithreaded HTTP web server written in C++ for CSE 333 (University of Washington). It supports file serving and a search engine built on precomputed inverted indices.

## 🌐 Live in Codespaces

### 🚀 To run the server:

1. **Click "Code" > "Codespaces" > "Create codespace on master"**
2. Wait ~1–2 mins for setup (Docker + `make` auto-run)
3. You’ll see **Port 8000** appear and auto-open in the browser
4. You’re ready to go! Start searching or navigate to static files.
